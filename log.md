### Day 1: April 07, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: For wedding app, created a task fueture for users to organize their wedding categories. Scaffolded fields required to create a new task. Wrote unit test for the feature.  

**Thoughts:** I'm following the stories as broken down during wireframing. I'm making sure every feature gets tested prior to pushing and merging with master. Feels good to make progress.
